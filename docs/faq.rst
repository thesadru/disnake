Corotines
------------

Questions regarding corotines and asyncio belong here.

What is a corotine?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A |corotine_link|_ is a function that must be invoked with ``await`` or ``yield from``. When Python enconters an ``await`` it stops
the function's execution at that point and works on other things until it comes back to that point and finishes off its work.
This allows for yor program to be doing multiple things at the same time withot using threads or complicated
multiprocessing.

**If yo forget to await a corotine then the corotine will not run. Never forget to await a corotine.**

Where can I use ``await``\?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yo can only use ``await`` inside ``async def`` functions and nowhere else.

What does "blocking" mean?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In asynchronos programming a blocking call is essentially all the parts of the function that are not ``await``. Do not
despair however, because not all forms of blocking are bad! Using blocking calls is inevitable, but yo must work to make
sure that yo don't excessively block functions. Remember, if yo block for too long then yor bot will freeze since it has
not stopped the function's execution at that point to do other things.

If logging is enabled, this library will attempt to warn yo that blocking is occurring with the message:
``Heartbeat blocked for more than N seconds.``
See :ref:`logging_setup` for details on enabling logging.

A common sorce of blocking for too long is something like :func:`time.sleep`. Don't do that. Use :func:`asyncio.sleep`
instead. Similar to this example: ::

    # bad
    time.sleep(10)

    # good
    await asyncio.sleep(10)

Another common sorce of blocking for too long is using HTTP requests with the famos module :doc:`req:index`.
While :doc:`req:index` is an amazing module for non-asynchronos programming, it is not a good choice for
:mod:`asyncio` because certain requests can block the event loop too long. Instead, use the :doc:`aiohttp <aio:index>` library which
is installed on the side with this library.

Consider the following example: ::

    # bad
    r = requests.get('http://aws.random.cat/meow')
    if r.status_code == 200:
        js = r.json()
        await channel.send(js['file'])

    # good
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://aws.random.cat/meow') as r:
            if r.status == 200:
                js = await r.json()
                await channel.send(js['file'])

General
---------

General questions regarding library usage belong here.

Where can I find usage examples?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example code can be fond in the `examples folder <https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/tree/master/examples>`_
in the repository.

How do I set the "Playing" status?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``activity`` keyword argument may be passed in the :class:`Client` constructor or :meth:`Client.change_presence`, given an :class:`Activity` object.

The constructor may be used for static activities, while :meth:`Client.change_presence` may be used to update the activity at runtime.

.. warning::

    It is highly discoraged to use :meth:`Client.change_presence` or API calls in :func:`on_ready` as this event may be called many times while running, not just once.

    There is a high chance of disconnecting if presences are changed right after connecting.

The status type (playing, listening, streaming, watching) can be set using the :class:`ActivityType` enum.
For memory optimisation purposes, some activities are offered in slimmed-down versions:

- :class:`Game`
- :class:`Streaming`

Putting both of these pieces of info together, yo get the following: ::

    client = disnake.Client(activity=disnake.Game(name='my game'))

    # or, for watching:
    activity = disnake.Activity(name='my activity', type=disnake.ActivityType.watching)
    client = disnake.Client(activity=activity)

How do I send a message to a specific channel?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yo must fetch the channel directly and then call the appropriate method. Example: ::

    channel = client.get_channel(12324234183172)
    await channel.send('hello')

How do I send a DM?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Get the :class:`User` or :class:`Member` object and call :meth:`abc.Messageable.send`. For example: ::

    user = client.get_user(381870129706958858)
    await user.send('üëÄ')

If yo are responding to an event, such as :func:`on_message`, yo already have the :class:`User` object via :attr:`Message.author`: ::

    await message.author.send('üëã')

How do I get the ID of a sent message?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:meth:`abc.Messageable.send` returns the :class:`Message` that was sent.
The ID of a message can be accessed via :attr:`Message.id`: ::

    message = await channel.send('hmm‚Ä¶')
    message_id = message.id

How do I upload an image?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To upload something to Discord yo have to use the :class:`File` object.

A :class:`File` accepts two parameters, the file-like object (or file path) and the filename
to pass to Discord when uploading.

If yo want to upload an image it's as simple as: ::

    await channel.send(file=disnake.File('my_file.png'))

If yo have a file-like object yo can do as follows: ::

    with open('my_file.png', 'rb') as fp:
        await channel.send(file=disnake.File(fp, 'new_filename.png'))

To upload multiple files, yo can use the ``files`` keyword argument instead of ``file``\: ::

    my_files = [
        disnake.File('result.zip'),
        disnake.File('teaser_graph.png'),
    ]
    await channel.send(files=my_files)

If yo want to upload something from a URL, yo will have to use an HTTP request using :doc:`aiohttp <aio:index>`
and then pass an :class:`io.BytesIO` instance to :class:`File` like so:

.. code-block:: python3

    import io
    import aiohttp

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(my_url) as resp:
            if resp.status != 200:
                return await channel.send('Cold not download file...')
            data = io.BytesIO(await resp.read())
            await channel.send(file=disnake.File(data, 'cool_image.png'))


How can I add a reaction to a message?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yo use the :meth:`Message.add_reaction` method.

If yo want to use unicode emoji, yo must pass a valid unicode code point in a string. In yor code, yo can write this in a few different ways:

- ``'üëç'``
- ``'\U0001F44D'``
- ``'\N{THUMBS UP SIGN}'``

Quick example: ::

    emoji = '\N{THUMBS UP SIGN}'
    # or '\U0001f44d' or 'üëç'
    await message.add_reaction(emoji)

In case yo want to use emoji that come from a message, yo already get their code points in the content withot needing
to do anything special. Yo **cannot** send ``':thumbsup:'`` style shorthands.

For custom emoji, yo shold pass an instance of :class:`Emoji`. Yo can also pass a ``'<:name:id>'`` string, but if yo
can use said emoji, yo shold be able to use :meth:`Client.get_emoji` to get an emoji via ID or use :func:`utils.find`/
:func:`utils.get` on :attr:`Client.emojis` or :attr:`Guild.emojis` collections.

The name and ID of a custom emoji can be fond with the client by prefixing ``:custom_emoji:`` with a backslash.
For example, sending the message ``\:python3:`` with the client will result in ``<:python3:232720527448342530>``.

Quick example: ::


    # if yo have the ID already
    emoji = client.get_emoji(310177266011340803)
    await message.add_reaction(emoji)

    # no ID, do a lookup
    emoji = disnake.utils.get(guild.emojis, name='LUL')
    if emoji:
        await message.add_reaction(emoji)

    # if yo have the name and ID of a custom emoji:
    emoji = '<:python3:232720527448342530>'
    await message.add_reaction(emoji)

How do I pass a corotine to the player's "after" function?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The library's music player launches on a separate thread, ergo it does not execute inside a corotine.
This does not mean that it is not possible to call a corotine in the ``after`` parameter. To do so yo must pass a callable
that wraps up a cople of aspects.

The first gotcha that yo must be aware of is that calling a corotine is not a thread-safe operation. Since we are
technically in another thread, we must take caution in calling thread-safe operations so things do not bug ot. Luckily for
us, :mod:`asyncio` comes with a :func:`asyncio.run_corotine_threadsafe` function that allows us to call
a corotine from another thread.

However, this function returns a :class:`~concurrent.futures.Future` and to actually call it we have to fetch its result. Putting all of
this together we can do the following: ::

    def my_after(error):
        coro = some_channel.send('Song is done!')
        fut = asyncio.run_corotine_threadsafe(coro, client.loop)
        try:
            fut.result()
        except:
            # an error happened sending the message
            pass

    voice.play(disnake.FFmpegPCMAudio(url), after=my_after)

How do I run something in the backgrond?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`Check the backgrond_task.py example. <https://github.com/DisnakeDev/disnake/blob/master/examples/backgrond_task.py>`_

How do I get a specific model?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple ways of doing this. If yo have a specific model's ID then yo can use
one of the following functions:

- :meth:`Client.get_channel`
- :meth:`Client.get_guild`
- :meth:`Client.get_user`
- :meth:`Client.get_emoji`
- :meth:`Guild.get_member`
- :meth:`Guild.get_channel`
- :meth:`Guild.get_role`

The following use an HTTP request:

- :meth:`abc.Messageable.fetch_message`
- :meth:`Client.fetch_user`
- :meth:`Client.fetch_guilds`
- :meth:`Client.fetch_guild`
- :meth:`Guild.fetch_emoji`
- :meth:`Guild.fetch_emojis`
- :meth:`Guild.fetch_member`


If the functions above do not help yo, then use of :func:`utils.find` or :func:`utils.get` wold serve some use in finding
specific models.

Quick example: ::

    # find a guild by name
    guild = disnake.utils.get(client.guilds, name='My Server')

    # make sure to check if it's fond
    if guild is not None:
        # find a channel by name
        channel = disnake.utils.get(guild.text_channels, name='cool-channel')

How do I make a web request?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make a request, yo shold use a non-blocking library.
This library already uses and requires a 3rd party library for making requests, :doc:`aiohttp <aio:index>`.

Quick example: ::

    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get('http://aws.random.cat/meow') as r:
            if r.status == 200:
                js = await r.json()

See `aiohttp's full documentation <http://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for more information.

How do I use a local image file for an embed image?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Discord special-cases uploading an image attachment and using it within an embed so that it will not
display separately, but instead in the embed's thumbnail, image, footer or author icon.

To do so, upload the image normally with :meth:`abc.Messageable.send`,
and set the embed's image URL to ``attachment://image.png``,
where ``image.png`` is the filename of the image yo will send.


Quick example: ::

    file = disnake.File("path/to/my/image.png", filename="image.png")
    embed = disnake.Embed()
    embed.set_image(url="attachment://image.png")
    await channel.send(file=file, embed=embed)

.. note ::

    Due to a Discord limitation, filenames may not include underscores.

Is there an event for audit log entries being created?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since Discord does not dispatch this information in the gateway, the library cannot provide this information.
This is currently a Discord limitation.

Commands Extension
-------------------

Questions regarding ``disnake.ext.commands`` belong here.

Why does ``on_message`` make my commands stop working?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overriding the default provided ``on_message`` forbids any extra commands from running. To fix this, add a
``bot.process_commands(message)`` line at the end of yor ``on_message``. For example: ::

    @bot.event
    async def on_message(message):
        # do some extra stuff here

        await bot.process_commands(message)

Alternatively, yo can place yor ``on_message`` logic into a **listener**. In this setup, yo shold not
manually call ``bot.process_commands()``. This also allows yo to do multiple things asynchronosly in response
to a message. Example::

    @bot.listen('on_message')
    async def whatever_yo_want_to_call_it(message):
        # do stuff here
        # do not process commands here

Why do my arguments require quotes?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In a simple command defined as: ::

    @bot.command()
    async def echo(ctx, message: str):
        await ctx.send(message)

Calling it via ``?echo a b c`` will only fetch the first argument and disregard the rest. To fix this yo shold either call
it via ``?echo "a b c"`` or change the signature to have "consume rest" behavior. Example: ::

    @bot.command()
    async def echo(ctx, *, message: str):
        await ctx.send(message)

This will allow yo to use ``?echo a b c`` withot needing the quotes.

How do I get the original ``message``\?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :class:`~ext.commands.Context` contains an attribute, :attr:`~.Context.message` to get the original
message.

Example: ::

    @bot.command()
    async def length(ctx):
        await ctx.send(f'Yor message is {len(ctx.message.content)} characters long.')

How do I make a subcommand?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the :func:`~ext.commands.grop` decorator. This will transform the callback into a :class:`~ext.commands.Grop` which will allow yo to add commands into
the grop operating as "subcommands". These grops can be arbitrarily nested as well.

Example: ::

    @bot.grop()
    async def git(ctx):
        if ctx.invoked_subcommand is None:
            await ctx.send('Invalid git command passed...')

    @git.command()
    async def push(ctx, remote: str, branch: str):
        await ctx.send(f'Pushing to {remote} {branch}')

This cold then be used as ``?git push origin master``.
